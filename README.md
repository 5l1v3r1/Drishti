# Drishti : A fast HTTP response status inspector

![Drishti](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devanshbatham/Drishti/master/static/drishti.PNG)
## What is Drishti 
**_Drishti_** is a Sanskrit word _meaning_ "**sight**" and refers to the **gazing technique** . I create this tool to gaze at the HTTP response of the urls . I created this tool for my personal use. Now making it public !

## Why 

During Recon you sometimes might get a lot of domains/subdomains/url endpoints , and ofcourse it is not possible for a normal human being to look into each domain/subdomain/url endpoint one by one (atleast not possible for me). Using **Drishti** you can automate this task, just paste the domains/urls in `raw_urls.txt` file and run the program. It will return the status code of the domains/subdomains/urls. **Drishti** uses aiohttp/asyncio which makes this tool asynchronous , and hence it is way much faster than a traditional python script using `requests` or `urllib` 

## How to use :
```
mkdir Drishti
cd Drishti
git clone https://github.com/devanshbatham/Drishti
sudo apt install python3.7 python3-venv python3.7-venv
python3.7 -m venv py37-venv
. py37-venv/bin/activate
cd Drishti
pip install -r requirements.txt
"paste the urls/domains/subdomains in raw_urls.txt"
python drishti.py
```
## Example : 

```
file : raw_urls.txt
